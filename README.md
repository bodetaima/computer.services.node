# Yet another Computer Service...but written in Node

Clone this repo, as usual.

Good old install for a little bit of depressing.

`npm install`

It will not take long, I guess. Now examine the package.json for something useful. If you just too lazy, here:

`npm run live`

The Frankenstein is live on port 1025.

Have fun depressing!
